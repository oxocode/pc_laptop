PC DEVA - PC Development Environment + Vagrant Awesomeness

## say wha now?

An automated PC setup for development environment awesomeness:

Who _really_ wants to remember which blogs had the best steps for development setup, or have to remember the dev versions that _actually_ work for each piece of software on Windows? That was rhetorical.

## why?

If WATSON (yes, I name my devices) decided to flip me multiple middle fingers tomorrow, or if he (yes, he's a he) was ever stolen in an airport, I'd want to know that RAMPing up a new PC (God forbid) wouldn't take more than 1/142nd the amount of time it took me to setup the current PC dev environment that wins at the internet.

Plus, MacBook Pros are cool n' all, but I prefer PCs. How often do you hear of PC user crasping at straws to install a Mountain Lion, Snow Leopard, or a Maverick on a new partition? Hmm? Think it over. _Don't worry; I'll wait._
